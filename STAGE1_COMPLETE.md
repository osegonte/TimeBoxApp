# Stage 1: Code Assessment & Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Deleted Redundant Files (6 files removed)
- CalendarView.swift.backup
- DataModels.swift.backup
- TaskManager.swift.backup
- TasksView.swift.backup
- TimeBoxAppApp.swift.backup
- Daily (empty file)

### 2. Code Optimization Results

| File | Before | After | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| DataModels.swift | 250 lines | 107 lines | -57% |
| TimeBoxAppApp.swift | 55 lines | 23 lines | -58% |
| DailyTimelineView.swift | 470 lines | 430 lines | -9% (better architecture) |
| TaskManager.swift | 175 lines | 175 lines | Same size, better functionality |
| **Total** | ~2,150 lines | ~1,630 lines | **-24% reduction** |

### 3. Key Architectural Improvements

**Data Layer**
- Removed custom SleepScheduleStore class
- Now uses SwiftData consistently throughout
- Eliminated data synchronization issues
- Tasks auto-schedule to today if no date specified

**Task Management**
- Tasks now properly display on calendar
- Unscheduled tasks show at top of daily view
- Scheduled tasks show in their time slots
- Sleep schedule properly blocks time slots

**Code Quality**
- Removed 200+ lines of premature migration code
- Better separation of concerns
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Clean file structure ready for Stage 2

### 4. Verified Functionality ✅
- Task creation works
- Calendar display accurate
- Daily timeline shows all tasks
- Sleep schedule integration working
- Task scheduling functional
- Data persistence confirmed
